                    An Introducing Broker (IB) is an intermediary in the financial
                    markets that connects clients with a brokerage firm. IBs typically
                    do not execute trades themselves; instead, they refer clients to a
                    broker, earning a commission or fee for each trade the client
                    makes.
                </p>

                <p class="uk-text-lead uk-text-muted">
                    IBs often provide valuable services such as market analysis,
                    educational resources, and personalized support to help clients
                    make informed trading decisions. They can work in various
                    financial sectors, including Forex, stocks, and commodities. By
                    leveraging their relationships and knowledge of the market, IBs
                    can enhance the trading experience for their clients while
                    benefiting from the commissions they earn.
